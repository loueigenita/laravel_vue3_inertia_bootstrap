            <p> We continue rising to the challenge of developing new technologies that enable professional DJs to intuitively express themselves through sounds. Our core technology comprises user interface, digital audio analysis/processing, high-quality sound, and data analytics technologies. This, together with our decades of experience, helps us to support the performance of professional DJs, as well as bring creativity and diversity to the enjoyment of music by analyzing and utilizing data collected from around the globe to create new surprises, joy, and excitement. We're also engaging in new technologies that are important to the evolution and growth of our business, including AI, technologies related to the latest forms of music media, cloud and network technologies, and wireless technologies. All these technologies can be used in, or to support, products for all levels of DJs ー from first-timers to professionals. As a hardware company, we also recognize that it’s important to pay close attention to our use of finite resources and energy to realize a sustainable society. That's why we’re working to make our products more energy-efficient, smaller, and lighter, while striving to reduce the amount of plastic and parts in our products.
